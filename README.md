# Banking Transactions API

To run the API, you have to clone this repository. Then open an IDE. My recommendation is IntelliJ IDEA.
Import the project to your IDE. And wait for the dependencies to be downloaded.

After the dependencies are downloaded, you can run the app. To access Swagger UI, you can copy the following link to
test the API:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

Before you test the API. Go to ```application.properties``` file to see the H2 login credentials, in case you would like
to perform queries in the DB.
